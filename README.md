# transplant_analysis
Files and code to generate Bayly and Angert, J Biogeog, in revision.
Includes (1) integral projection models for transplant of E. cardinalis across its north range limit in Oregon 2014 - 2015 and (2) stream habitat ENM. Climate ENM were published in Angert et al. 2018 Am Nat; those input files, R scripts, and model outputs are on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By2O2s2azOy0dTd6ZUw5dUItQjQ


### Manuscript (Goole Drive):
Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion and Figures
Figures stored on Google Drive because pdf files too large <-- I'd like this to change if possible (Amy 11/15/18)

### Folder Overview:
#### /Data:
All raw field data and manually assembled data not subject change from R scripts.
Content: Site descriptions & locations; transplant data, plant measurements and temperature data.
#### /Rcode:
R code for analysis. Folders within: Data prep, IPMs, Stream ENM. Separate script Amy_suitability.R has all linear models for vitals or lambda ~ latitude or ENM scores. 

#### /Robjects:
R objects, intermediate data products, models and final report tables, except bootstrapping intermediate R outputs that are too large for Github; these are currently on the google drive. <-- I'd like this to change if possible (Amy 11/15/18). 

#### /Figures
Figures are stored separately in a Google Drive folder (large file size of multiple pdfs prevents storage on Github). <-- I'd like this to change if possible (Amy 11/15/18)
