Hi Matthew,

Here it is!
Column names correspond to 2010-2012 (ending _10 = 2010, etc.)
Class: A (adult), J (juvenile), D (dead), E (excluded), ? (not visited)
PercFr: proportion of flowers maturing a fruit
TotFr: total fruit #
TotFl: total flower #
TotNFStLn: total nonflowering stem length
TotFlStLn: total flowering stem length
TotStLn: total nonflowering stem length + total flowering stem length
Surv1011: survival from 2010 to 2011
Surv1112: survival from 2011 to 2012

I created a probability of flowering column afterwards in R, basically setting
probability of flowering = 1 when Class = adult and 0 when Class = Juvenile.

Let me know if you have any questions or problems!

Seema
